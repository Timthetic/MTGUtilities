## About The Project
This is one of my (Tim Rediehs) first indpendent projects. I love Magic: The Gathering, so I thought it would be fun to create an app that I could use to look up cards and keep track of life points during a game. It hasn't gotten much love in a few years.

## Team
### Timothy Rediehs (only developer)

I'm a student at UCLA who's primary interests are actually web technologies (particularly backend, APIs, and tools). I've been involved with a group on campus who's goal is to teach practical programming skills to other undergraduates as that goal closly aligns with my own. 
## Features
### Local Card Search
The main motivation was to have a local store of Magic cards to search though. It should be noted that the images are not stored locally since that would require a bit too much space.

You can even see different sets that a card was in. Clicking on one will show the image for that set so you can see the different arts for cards like Llanowar Elves or Shivan Dragon.

### Life Counter
The app also has a basic life counter. It supports 1-4 players.

You can pick turn order, colors, and names.

Additionally, the app will keep track of how damage was dealth throughout the game. A feature I had in mind for later was making a graph. Magic players tend to enjoy that kind of stuff. I know I do.
